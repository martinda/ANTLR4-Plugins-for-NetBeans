OpenIDE-Module-Name=Adhoc MIME Types
OpenIDE-Module-Short-Description=Provides a registry of synthesized MIME types
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=Provides a registry of synthesized MIME types based on \
    Antlr grammar information and grammar file paths, enabling Antlr files under editing \
    to have a file type and loader associated with them, so that live syntax highlighting \
    is available for files of a grammar type *while that grammar is being edited*.  Used \
    for the Antlr preview window to instantly see consequences of grammar edits.
