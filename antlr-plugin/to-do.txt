TEST for register lexer only grammar

Better error recovery for a partially typed line - fill in e.g. ": 'missing-token';


Need to cache semantic parse results.

Semantic parser cleanup and optimizations.  Can we just get rid of it and use Antlr directly?

Maybe separate the classloader for Antlr from the one for the rest and cache it for performance.

Rule tree needs the rules from imported grammars.  Or could add to its list and rejigger dynamically.


Save action does not unmark modified.

Cannot expose modification state of preview in tab name of editor.

Shared per-project environment to avoid creating so many JFS's?

Update output window in a background thread to avoid interfering with typing.


May have to just suppress offset errors in error highlighter - they can happen when typing fast in preview and
deleting tail lines.

Error highlighter always gets cancelled on initial parse - no initial error morkings, file must be manually modified.  Why?
