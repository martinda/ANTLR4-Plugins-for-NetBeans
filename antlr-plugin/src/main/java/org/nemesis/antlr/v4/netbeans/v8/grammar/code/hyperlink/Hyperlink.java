/**
 * An hyperlink points to a given file (it may exist or not).
 * If the given file does not exist then the hyperlink will not work (without
 * error message). As soon as the pointed file is created, the hyperlink will
 * be functional without reparsing the source file.
 * 
 * If the target is in the same file as the source of hyperlink, then there is
 * one and only one hyperlink per source.
 * 
 * But if the target may be in a file that can be in several directory, then
 * there is several hyperlinks per source. The hyperlinkProvider will chosse the
 * first that is pointing to an existing file.
