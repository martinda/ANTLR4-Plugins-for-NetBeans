/**
 * A general abstraction for the following situation: You have lots of objects
 * (such as files), and multiple parties may be interested in changes, parses,
 * or some sort of events on them - <i>and</i> those objects may be referenced
 * via more than one type (for example, the Document with the contents of a file
 * versus the file represented by a java.io.File, java.nio.Path or
 * org.netbeans.filesystems.FileObject).
 * <p>
 * SubscribableBuilder offers a wildly configurable means of building these,
 * including synchronous vs. asynchronous vs. coalesced asynchronous delivery of
 * events, customizable map (or other storage) backed storage, with strongly or
 * weakly keys and values, and more.
 * </p>
 * The SPI class SubscribableNotifier is used to deliver events, so that clients
 * that consume events are not exposed to the API for publishing events.
