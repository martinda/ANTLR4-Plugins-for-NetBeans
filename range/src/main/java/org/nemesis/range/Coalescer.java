/**
 * Coalesces two overlapping ranges. The use case is a common situation best
 * described by how it occurs in syntax highlighting. Say you have a bunch of
 * things that don't know about each other, and each one can highlight a range
 * of text as being some color, font style, underline, or whatever. So you wind
 * up with a bunch of ranges each of which may overlap others. To actually paint
 * the text, you need to coalesce that down to a series of non-overlapping
 * ranges which combine the attributes of the ranges you were passed - and
 * ideally you need to do this in an efficient, performance-sensitive way. So,
 * if we have a range A from 100 to 120 with font style BOLD, and you have a
 * range B from 110 to 130 with font color BLUE, what you need is a range
 * 100:110-BOLD, 110-120:BLUE+BOLD and 120:130:BLUE.
