        <div>
            <p>
                This package allows code-folding to be added to any project using
                the extraction framework (i.e. the parser result is an 
                <code>ExtractionParseResult</code>, regardless if any other
                of the related modules are used.
            </p>
            <p>
                To use, have ExtractionContributors registered which will scan the
                parse tree on a reparse and generate useful data for code-folding - 
                for example, collecting the bounds of all nodes belonging to a certain
                parse rule.  An Extraction contains a bunch of collections of such
                data, in highly compact yet performant form - each collection
                tied to a particular <code>ExtractionKey</code>, which is typically
                stored as a static field.  Simply annotate those static fields
                with <code><a href='AntlrFoldsRegistration.html'>&#064;AntlrFoldsRegistration</a></code>
                to add code folds to them, and the necessary code will be generated
                by the annotation processor.
            </p>

        <h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                All code folding implementations in the NetBeans codebase seem to
                be hacked together copy/paste implementations of the Java module's
                original spaghetti-code implementation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The code here was written by taking a careful look at exactly what
                that code did, and rewriting it with concerns cleanly separated 
                so it is maintainable.
