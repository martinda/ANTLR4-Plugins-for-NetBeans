ANTLR EDITING PLUGINS:

 - Maybe get the parsed grammar object out of the grammar result - no need to keep it hanging around, and it's not really used

 - Use same token ProxyToken for things with literal names?

 - AttrType is not coalescing background and foreground properly.

 - Make coalescing use evil continue-as-goto instead of recursion?

 - UI for ATN prediction at cursor

 - Sort out the range generics puzzle with coalescing

 - Put back formatting code from old module

 - Generic tracking code for things that should be garbage collected - JFS, JFSClassLoader

 - Get .tokens file contents / related grammar tokens into extraction / preview

 - The pattern matching stuff in antlr-formatters is exactly what is needed for code completion - extract and generify it

!!! Font color entries not written to layer unless the annotation processor
is called multiple times (e.g. there is another highlighting entry on a
highlighter registration annotation on a key).

fix coalescer to support longs


-------

Declarative registraton of resolvers, actual attribution phase

Use new carets api to do inplace rename refactoring

Maybe generic scoping - parser rule based what can reference what?

CODE COMPLETION:
 - Annotation + processor for registering it - OR ADD TO AntlrLanguageRegistration so it can access parser / lexer
    - Filter tokens optionally
    - Insertion policy (prepend/append space under what conditions)
 - Ability to flag a named region extraction key as providing completions after a list of tokens
    - Ability to intercept and filter based on scope
 - Generic extraction-based completion contributor

FORMATTING:

 - Rename AntlrFormatterProvider to AntlrFormatter and update in the annotation processor
 - REINDENT SUPPORT
 - Wrapping lines action is not getting the correct line position and going insane
 - Should preserve whitespace if no action taken
 - UI support and choosable formatting actions


ACTIONS:

 - Most likely just need to use shared action names now that they're in the editor kit
   - Well, that's a big fat NOPE.

OTHER:
 - Generic indexing support
