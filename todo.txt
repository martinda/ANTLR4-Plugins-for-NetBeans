Declarative registraton of resolvers, actual attribution phase

Use new carets api to do inplace rename refactoring

Supply an alternate reference key for region names, not just have types

Add arbitrary scoping using other elements.

Get the antlr module working

Hooks for dataobject methods, needed for antlr module's grammar file delete handling

FORMATTING:

 - Rename AntlrFormatterProvider to AntlrFormatter and update in the annotation processor
 - REINDENT SUPPORT
 - Wrapping lines action is not getting the correct line position and going insane
 - Should preserve whitespace if no action taken

ANNOTATION PROCESSORS:

 - Split AnnotationUtils and validators into separate project
 - Split java code generation into separate project
 - Split annotation processing into phases, so ALL validation for a processor runs before ANY code is generated
 - ClassBuilder and friends need an easy and intuitive way to do "new" rather than bundling it into the type name


ACTIONS:

 - Most likely just need to use shared action names now that they're in the editor kit
   - Well, that's a big fat NOPE.
