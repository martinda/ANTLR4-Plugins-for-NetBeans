# Antlr Editing Plugins To-Dos

 - Use @ConvertAsProperties on preview

 - Java embedding for Antlr, general Antlr embedding support

 - Goto decl should also resolve imports - expose keys

 - Error highlighting should show unresolvable imports

 - Antlr name references are not detected if the format is "foo=someRule"

 - Track insertions and update custom highlighting offsets in adhoc highlighting sequence?
   - Could use general support for sets of ranges in the range library

 - Formatter settings not being picked up

 - Split out import finder from the resolving stuff?
    - @ImportNames annotation to auto generate name resolution / goto declaration support
       - Strategy for relative path lookups?

 - Fix AdhocColoringRegistry to use import finder, not actually resolve everything unless needed

 - Enhance relative resolvers in the nb specialization project to look up tokens files, etc. from the project's ClassPathProvider

 - Keybinding actions still not actually working if not performers for standard netbeans ones

 - Should keep a cache of resolvable variable names by file, so as not to resolve them
and parse multiple files and do many graph traversals on every reparse.  Cache should listen
on target file and dispose on modification.  Can't be in the extraction project due to
file object type and listening requirement.

 
 - Resolve via tokens file into other project on classpath via ClassPathProvider

 - Maybe get the parsed grammar object out of the grammar result - no need to keep it hanging around, 
   and it's not really used except for update check - could just keep the JFSFileModifications snapshot
   and that is enough; those things that actually need the output should get them via the as yet
   unused antlr output api.

 - Make coalescing use evil continue-as-goto instead of recursion?

 - UI for ATN prediction at cursor - started in parser-recorder

 - Sort out the range generics puzzle with coalescing

 - Get .tokens file contents / related grammar tokens into extraction / preview

 - The pattern matching stuff in antlr-formatters is exactly what is needed for code completion - extract and generify it

!!! Font color entries not written to layer unless the annotation processor
is called multiple times (e.g. there is another highlighting entry on a
highlighter registration annotation on a key).

fix coalescer to support longs

# General Antlr Plugin Support To-Dos

Use new carets api to do inplace rename refactoring

Maybe generic scoping - parser rule based what can reference what?


CODE COMPLETION:
 - Annotation + processor for registering it - OR ADD TO AntlrLanguageRegistration so it can access parser / lexer
    - Filter tokens optionally
    - Insertion policy (prepend/append space under what conditions)
 - Ability to flag a named region extraction key as providing completions after a list of tokens
    - Ability to intercept and filter based on scope
 - Generic extraction-based completion contributor

FORMATTING:

 - Rename AntlrFormatterProvider to AntlrFormatter and update in the annotation processor
 - REINDENT SUPPORT
 - Wrapping lines action is not getting the correct line position and going insane
 - Should preserve whitespace if no action taken

ACTIONS:

 - Most likely just need to use shared action names now that they're in the editor kit
   - Well, that's a big fat NOPE.

OTHER:
 - Generic indexing support
   - Annotation?
