FORMATTING:

Add a BitSet to ?

 - FormattingRules.whenInParserRule() + way to get parser from AntlrFormatterProvider

 - Rename AntlrFormatterProvider to AntlrFormatter and update in the annotation processor

 - REINDENT SUPPORT

 - Use SemanticRegions<Integer> to detect rule presence?


 - Applying the selection should *center* the new selection rectangle over the original one, not just shift it


 - Selection problems:
   - Caret position start is getting set on the first matching *whitespace* token, 
     rather than the first token we really used.  Move that code out of the token reading loop,
     and use the final computation of last matching token (which may be the EOF token - 1)
